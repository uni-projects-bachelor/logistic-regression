# Logistic Regression on MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This project implements two popular logistic regression algorithms—**Softmax Regression** and **One-vs-All Classification**—applied to the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digit images, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Features

- **Softmax Regression**: A generalization of logistic regression for multi-class classification problems.
- **One-vs-All Classification**: An approach where multiple binary classifiers are trained to distinguish each class against all others.
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed evaluation of both algorithms on the MNIST dataset.
